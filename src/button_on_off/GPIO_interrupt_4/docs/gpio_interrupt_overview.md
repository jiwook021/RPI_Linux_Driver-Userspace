# Code Overview: gpio_interrupt.c

This code is a **Linux kernel module** that demonstrates how to handle **GPIO interrupts** on a Raspberry Pi, specifically focusing on debouncing and UART communication. Let's break down its purpose, functionality, and structure in detail.

---

### **Purpose of the Code**
The code serves two main purposes:
1. **GPIO Interrupt Handling**: It demonstrates how to handle GPIO interrupts in a Linux kernel module. GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins are used to interact with external hardware, and interrupts allow the system to respond immediately to changes in the GPIO pin state (e.g., a button press).
2. **UART Communication**: It initializes and uses UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) to send data (e.g., debug messages or status updates) over a serial connection. UART is a common protocol for serial communication between devices.

The code also addresses a common issue in GPIO interrupt handling: **debouncing**. Debouncing is necessary because mechanical switches (like buttons) can produce multiple rapid state changes (bounces) when pressed or released, which can trigger multiple interrupts unintentionally. The code includes a software-based debouncing mechanism to filter out these false triggers.

---

### **Main Functionality**
1. **GPIO Interrupt Handling**:
   - The code sets up a GPIO pin to trigger an interrupt when its state changes (e.g., a button is pressed).
   - It includes a debouncing mechanism to prevent multiple interrupts from being triggered due to mechanical switch bouncing.

2. **UART Initialization and Communication**:
   - The code initializes UART5 on the Raspberry Pi, configuring it for a specific baud rate (115,200 bps).
   - It provides functions to send individual characters and strings over UART, which can be used for debugging or communication with other devices.

---

### **Algorithms and Techniques Used**
1. **Debouncing**:
   - The code uses a software-based debouncing mechanism to filter out false interrupts caused by mechanical switch bouncing. This is done by measuring the time between interrupts and ignoring those that occur too close together.

2. **UART Configuration**:
   - The UART is configured using a fixed baud rate (115,200 bps). The baud rate divisor is calculated and set in the UART's integer and fractional baud rate registers (`IBRD` and `FBRD`).

3. **Memory-Mapped I/O**:
   - The code uses memory-mapped I/O to interact with the UART hardware. It maps the UART's base address to a virtual address in kernel space using `ioremap()` and accesses the UART registers through pointers.

---

### **Overall Structure**
The code is structured into several key parts:
1. **Header Files**:
   - The code includes various Linux kernel headers for GPIO, interrupts, UART, memory mapping, and other kernel functionalities.

2. **Macros and Constants**:
   - Defines constants like `UART5_BASE` (the base address of UART5) and `BLOCK_SIZE` (the size of the memory block to map).

3. **Global Variables**:
   - Declares pointers to UART registers (`uart5_dr`, `uart5_fr`, etc.) and a buffer for UART data (`uart_buff`).

4. **UART Initialization**:
   - The `uart5_init()` function maps the UART hardware registers to kernel memory and configures the baud rate.

5. **UART Communication Functions**:
   - `uart_send_char()` sends a single character over UART.
   - `uart_send_str()` sends a string over UART by iterating through each character.

6. **GPIO Interrupt Handling**:
   - Although not fully shown in the provided code, the GPIO interrupt handling would typically involve:
     - Configuring the GPIO pin as an input.
     - Setting up an interrupt handler to respond to state changes.
     - Implementing debouncing logic to filter out false triggers.

---

### **How the Parts Work Together**
1. **Initialization**:
   - The UART is initialized during module loading, allowing the kernel to send debug messages or status updates over the serial connection.
   - The GPIO pin is configured to trigger interrupts when its state changes.

2. **Interrupt Handling**:
   - When the GPIO pin state changes (e.g., a button is pressed), the interrupt handler is invoked.
   - The debouncing mechanism ensures that only valid state changes are processed.

3. **UART Communication**:
   - The UART functions (`uart_send_char()` and `uart_send_str()`) can be used within the interrupt handler or other parts of the code to send data over the serial connection.

---

### **Problem Being Solved**
1. **GPIO Interrupts**:
   - The code solves the problem of responding to external events (e.g., button presses) in real-time using GPIO interrupts.
   - It also addresses the issue of switch bouncing, which can cause multiple interrupts to be triggered for a single event.

2. **UART Communication**:
   - The code provides a way to send data over a serial connection, which is useful for debugging or communicating with other devices.

---

### **Approach Taken**
1. **Kernel Module**:
   - The code is written as a Linux kernel module, which allows it to interact directly with hardware and handle interrupts.

2. **Memory-Mapped I/O**:
   - The UART hardware is accessed using memory-mapped I/O, which is a common technique for interacting with hardware in embedded systems.

3. **Software Debouncing**:
   - The code implements a software-based debouncing mechanism to filter out false interrupts, as the Raspberry Pi does not support hardware debouncing for GPIO interrupts.

### **Summary**
This code is a practical example of how to handle GPIO interrupts and UART communication in a Linux kernel module. It demonstrates key concepts like memory-mapped I/O, interrupt handling, and debouncing, making it a valuable learning resource for embedded systems programming. The UART functionality complements the GPIO interrupt handling by providing a way to send debug or status information over a serial connection.
